With\nthe rising demand to secure energy sources particularly at low prices there is\na competition for resources. Global, social, economic and environment goals of\nsustainability cannot be achieved if energy security is not achieved. The\nInternational Energy Agency forecasts that the world primary energy demand will\ngrow by 1.6 percent per year on average in 2006-2030. Rising energy needs has\nalways been a major concern in India\u2019s growth endeavor and energy security is\ngoing to be one of the most crucial economic and strategic policy challenges\nfor India in the next few decades, especially with an additional goal of\nfollowing a low carbon growth path. With increased economic growth, changing\nlifestyle and increase in energy intensity in the economy, ensuring reliable\nand cheap supply of clean energy to the Indian economy will be a difficult\ntask. A recent report by World Economic Forum, tried to estimate the challenges\nfaced by countries to achieve energy security in a sustainable way. According\nto this study, India is ranked 98th among 124 countries in terms of providing\nenergy security and access to its citizens. To ensure an acceptable level of\nenergy consumption for everyone, the overall availability ofenergy would need\nto be increasedsubstantially.Renewable energy resources are an important\nconsideration which offer a chance for reduced carbon 4emissions, cleaner air\nand a more sustainable use of earth resources. Technology options like\ncogeneration have become more important. Energy governance plays an important\nrole in standardization. Decision trees, regulatory considerations and\nsustainability criteria help in achieving good governance in transportation\nsector and other end use sectors. There is active engagement of governments in\nadapting international policy in domestic front and developing better\nregulatory and pricing structures in the energy markets. Objective of the\nCourse: a. The course will equip students to understand the ongoing\ntechnological, policy and implementation aspects related to different forms of\nenergy used worldwide. b. A critical understanding on the development of\nnational policies and technology deployment vis a vis economics of energy. c.\nUnderstanding interdisciplinary aspects of policy and socio-economic contexts\nin energy commercialization worldwide d. Understanding factors related to\ngeopolitical stability, geographical accessibility and underdeveloped\ninternational as well as domestic energy markets Teaching- Learning\nMethodology: The method of teaching-learning such a course on Energy: Policy\nand Governance has to maximize the (1) information package (2) provide an\ninterdisciplinary focus into the multiple considerations of implementing energy\ntechnologies from a technical, policy and governance perspective. A combination\nof lectures, interactive exercises, assignments, case studies will form the\nmethod of teaching-learning. Student will learn about the different energy\n\n\ftypes, their production and policy influences on energy use and development,\ngovernance and regulation. 5The course may facilitate one visit to the nearest\nenergy unit/WBREDA implementing units to enable students to practically\nunderstand related to policy support, compliance requirements and certain\naspects of energy commercialization.", "grades": {}, "id": "ES60007"}, "ES60002": {"rating": 4, "name": "WASTE TO WEALTH: MICROBIAL INTERVENTION", "credits": 4, "prereq": [], "syllabus": "Syllabus:Topics and LecturesIntroduction: Glimpses of microbial world towards\nbiofuel/bioenergy production frombiomass,Lectures=2Biomass characterization\n(Biophysical, Biochemical, Physicochemical, thermal, etc.) ,Lectures=\n2Microbial Growth kinetics of pure and mixed culture ,Lectures=4Mechanisms of\nReactions: Pathways involved in waste to energy production,Lectures= 5Metabolic\nand media engineering in biomass conversion,Lectures= 4Microbiology of aerobes\nand anaerobes,Lectures= 2Mechanism of bioconversion process ,Lectures=2Trends\nin biofuel production: First, second, third and fourth generation biofuel\n,Lectures=2Biohydrogen ,Lectures=1Oleaginous biodiesel production,Lectures=\n2Microbial fuel cells ,Lectures=1Bioremediation of heavy metals, xenobiotics\nand hazardous wastes,Lectures= 2Biofertlizers ,Lectures=3Value added product\ndevelopment and its cost effective recovery,Lectures= 4Conventional and\nnonconventional techniques adopted for product recovery and\nitscharacterization,Lectures=3Bioindicators, Biomarker, Biosensor,\nBioluminescence ,Lectures=3Toxicity analysis, Environmental safety through Bioagents ,Lectures=2TOTAL 44Reference Books:1.
