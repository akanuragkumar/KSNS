# KSNS
Kourse Structre is Not Structured

This repository is about Machine Learning and **Kumar Srinivas**.<br/>
Everyone in our wing knows that there is no one more regular in going to classes than our Kumar Srinivas.<br/>
I watched him every day, crossing my doors with a red bag, *whatta scenery in motion*!<br/>
I always wondered at times like these, **is it this hard to become a Civil Engineer?**<br/>

So:<br/>
- If you don't want to take the classes under a particular department but would like to learn the concepts.
- If you don't want to carry red bags on your shoulders but would like to get smarter two day before exams.

This is for you:<br/>
- Why not look for a similar course in a different department.<br/>
- Why not just say **Kumar Srinivas's Not from South**.

## What is the algorithm behind it?

KSNS compares syllabus of two subjects. The recommendation scores reflect the overlap of the syllabi between two subjects.<br/>
It uses a simple mathematical tool called [Singular Value Decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular-value_decomposition).

## Contributions

I am planning to make this a heroku application. You can help me with the front-end. We would develop a flask application. Do have a look at [Gyft-frontend](https://github.com/nishnik/gyft-serve) for MVP.
